* smart
* creative
* thoughful, well organized UI
* right fit over what's easiest or most common (independent)
* modern styles with classic design (meaning that people can intuitively find what they need because of * thoughful, well organized UI)

UX:
----
I use a simple, but effective User Group Analysis process to identify and understand who your clients are. Ideally, we'll break them out into two or three key demographics in order to identify;
    - why they would go to your site
    - what information they want from your site
    - what actions you want them to take

  Using this information, we'll plan out each page of your website by drawing simple "wire frames" on paper or a whiteboard. These wire frames will describe the content layout and organization that best meet the needs of your clients and achieve your business goals.


Design & Branding
    Modern, beautiful websites created with professionally designed themes from curated theme collections. I work with you to make sure you have the right theme to fit your brand.


Customized UI
   Your website works for you and your clients. I take the time to understand who your clients and users are and create a workflow and layout that meets your needs.

Integrations
   Use the tools you love. Use third-party services to enhance your website; from SEO Analytics, to social media feeds, photo galleries, newsletters, scheduling, e-commerce, and more.


Education
  Take control of your site. I take time to teach you how to manage and update your site and content using customized resources and teaching materials.

Technologies I use

  HTML & CSS
    - I work primarily in HTML and CSS and am familiar with older and newer versions of both.
  JavaScript & jQuery
    - I use JavaScript for some page elements and jQuery for API calls for 3rd party integrations.
  Static HTML Generators
    - I use Jekyll and Middleman to create simple, clean, beautiful websites.
  Sinatra & Rails
    - I use Sinatra for projects that make API calls and small rails projects with Ruby/Rails devs.

    My Work

    Edify

    This website is a rebranding project created for training consultant Kristen Gallagher, owner of "Edify". The project is done in <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and features integration with <a href="http://prose.io/#about">Prose.io</a> to enable Kristen to create, edit, and manage her own website content.

    Down to Earth Dog Lady</h3>
    This website is a new project created for Erin Marion, a dog trainer launching her training business, "The Down to Earth Dog Lady". The project is done in Sinatra and features a photo gallery integration with Instagram, a newsletter form with Mailchimp, and an online scheduling system with Acuity.

    Schouvi Stylist</h3>
    This website is a new project created for Schouvi, a hair and makeup artist launching her stylist business, "Schouvi Style". This simple, one-page site utilizes a creative photo gallery theme that highlights her rich, vibrant photography. The project is done in Sinatra and virtually all the content is dynamically generated via an API call to her Instagram feed.

    Project Description</h3>
    <p class="">
    This website is a rebranding project created for training consultant Kristen Gallagher, owner of "Edify". The project is done in <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll, 'a simple, blog-aware, static site generator'.</a> and features integration with <a href="http://prose.io/#about">Prose.io</a> to enable Kristen to create, edit, and manage her own website content.
                      Project Discovery and Planning</h3>

    <p class="">
      I had worked with Kristen in the past to teach her how to create a Jekyll project out of her previous Wordpress site as a way to better understand Internet technology and gain more direct control over her site theme, layout, and content.  Kristen contacted me some time later to say that she was ready to do some rebranding for her business and wanted to discuss doing this for her website as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      User Group Analysis:
      We met and went through a simple, but effective User Group Analysis process to analyze clients in her top two target demographics in order to identify;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>why they would go to her site</li>
      <li>what information they wanted from her site</li>
      <li>what actions she wanted them to take</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Using this information, we planned out each page of her website by drawing simple "wire frames" to describe the content layout and organization that would best meet the needs of her clients and achieve her business goals.

    </div>

    Branding and Marketing</h3>
    <p class="">
      Kristen worked with logo designer <a href="#">NAME</a> to create  her new branding materials including website elements like colors, fonts, and logo formats. I compiled these <a href="#">Branding Guidelines</a> onto a page on her site and a PDF document.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once her branding materials were complete, I put together a collection of themes that fit with her new branding for her to choose from. Once a theme was selected, we began to implement her new site.
    </p>
    </div>

    Integrations</h3>
    <p class="">
      We explored a variety of third-party services she could use to enhance her website and streamline her business processes.
    </p>

    Prose.io</h5>
    <a href="http://prose.io/#about">Prose.io</a> is a "beautifully simple web-based interface for managing and editing content on CMS-free websites.

    MailChimp</h5>
    Her site also includes integration with <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp, an email marketing platform</a> via a simple sign-up form embedded in the footer of every page and a full form on her contact page. This simple integration allows her to collect information about her clients and share news and updates via email newsletters in a beautiful and professional looking format that keeps her client info secure and confidential.

    SEO (Google Analytics)</h5>
    <p>
      I added Google Analytics to her site and included all relevant information about her site in Google's webmaster tools to ensure that data is being collected about how clients find the site and how they use it once they get there.
    </p>

    Project Description</h3>
    <p class="">
      This website is a new project created for Erin Marion, a dog trainer launching her training business, "The Down to Earth Dog Lady". The project is done in <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinatra_(software)">small and flexible open source framework written in Ruby</a> which enabled her site to make API calls to third-party services that enhanced her website and streamlined her business processes. This project features a photo gallery using her business's Instagram feed, a newsletter form with Mailchimp, and an online scheduling system with Acuity.

      </div>

    Project Discovery and Planning</h3>
    <p class="">
      Erin had a strong Facebook page presence but no website prior to this so we began by discussing the style and personality she wanted to convey to potential clients. We also did an informal discovery process to identify the type of content and general organization she wanted to present.
    </p>
    <p>
      From there, I put together a collection of possible themes for her to choose from. Once a theme was selected, we did a more formal user group analysis and planned out each page of her website to meet the needs of her clients and achieve her business goals.
    </p>

    Branding and Marketing</h3>
    <p class="">
      When we began, she had a logo designed by <a href="https://jesshuang.carbonmade.com/">Jessica Huang</a>, but did not yet have any further branding.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked with Erin and her logo designer to identify additional branding elements including; colors, fonts, logo formats, and marketing materials layouts. I compiled these <a href="http://downtoearthdoglady.com/branding">Branding Guidelines</a> onto a page on her site and a PDF document.
    </p>

      <img src="/img/dtedl/brand-guidelines.png" alt=""/>
    </div>

    You Tube</h4>
    <p class="">
      I filmed and produced a short promotional and informational video titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/lGMKkCY71iE?list=PLtqqRncgwzqQur8dTw0DHN-JfvludGbv2">Pack Hikes with the Down to Earth Dog Lady</a>" about a new service she offers called "Pack Hikes". This video is primarily for dog owners with dogs who spend a lot of time at home during the weekday and who need more exercise and training than they currently get. The video illustrates what happens on a pack hike and features a small but high-energy group of dogs being expertly trained and managed.
    </p>
    <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lGMKkCY71iE?list=PLtqqRncgwzqQur8dTw0DHN-JfvludGbv2" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    Facebook</h4>
    <p>
      I created a collection of Facebook promotions to boost client engagement and reach new clients during a particularly slow period. The promotion heavily featured Pack Hike photos and experimented with a few key demographics and key words to determine what worked best for each group. The promotion was highly effective and ended after a few weeks once Erin's schedule was as full as she was able to accommodate and her wait-list was as long as she felt was reasonable. These promotions remain in her account and can be easily reactivated any time she wishes.

    <img src="/img/dtedl/dtedl-fb-promo.png" alt=""/>
    </div>

    Integrations</h3>
    <p class="">
      We explored a variety of third-party services she could use to enhance her website and streamline her business processes. Because, as a dog trainer, she spends a lot of time outdoors and with clients, we decided early on that content updates for her site needed to be fast, easy, and mobile-capable.
    </p>

     Instagram</h5>
      <p>
        She was already using Instagram heavily to share images of her work with dogs, so it was an obvious choice to add an <a href="http://downtoearthdoglady.com/gallery"></a>Instagram photo gallery</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pi-col-md-6 pi-col-md-offset-1">
      <img src="/img/dtedl/dtedl-instagram-photo-gallery.png" alt=""/>
    </div>

    You Tube</h5>
    <p>
      I helped her create a set of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCufSSdFPyk7K9QLpFsQzueQ/playlists?shelf_id=0&sort=dd&view=1"></a>Youtube Playlists</a> that are embedded in relevant areas of her site to visually illustrate her most current work. She has the ability to add new videos to each play list via her phone or computer and they show up at the top of each list on her site.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pi-col-md-6 pi-col-md-offset-1">
    <img src="/img/dtedl/dtedl-video-gallery.png" alt=""/>
    </div>

    MailChimp</h5>
    <p>
      Her site also includes integration with <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp, an email marketing platform</a> via a simple sign-up form embedded in the footer of every page and a full form on her contact page. This simple integration allows her to collect information about her clients and share news and updates via email newsletters in a beautiful and professional looking format that keeps her client info secure and confidential.
    </p>

     Google Forms</h5>
      <p>
        I set up a Google form for collecting client emergency contact information that collects in a Google spreadsheet. Any time a client completes a form, a script is triggered to generate a new Google doc from a "mail merge" template complete with all the client information. This document is then filed in a folder that Erin can access at a moment's notice from her phone at any time - whether on the trail or at home. The file is also emailed to the client for verification of details and any editing or updating as necessary. This has saved her a great deal of effort in printing, filing, and transporting critical client emergency info.

    <div class="pi-col-md-6 pi-col-md-offset-1">
      <img src="/img/dtedl/dtedl-google-forms-integration.png" alt=""/>
    </div>

    Acuity</h5>
    <p>
      She began using an online scheduling service called <a href="https://acuityscheduling.com/">Acuity Scheduling</a> and early iterations of her site included API calls to display training classes, open lesson appointment times, and other training package deals that clients could register for online. We later realized her business didn't need that level of online integration and scaled back to simply display information about private lessons. She currently uses Acuity to schedule and track her appointments as well as sharing important documents like release forms and cancellation policies.
    </p>

    SEO (Google Analytics)</h5>
    <p>
      I added Google Analytics to her site and included all relevant information about her site in Google's webmaster tools to ensure that data is being collected about how clients find the site and how they use it once they get there. As this data is collected, I analyze it for any improvement opportunities and share that information with Erin.
    </p>


    Project Description</h3>
    <p class="">
      This website is a new project created for Schouvi, a hair and makeup artist launching her stylist business, "Schouvi Style". This simple, one-page site utilizes a creative photo gallery theme that highlights her rich, vibrant photography. The project is done in <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinatra_(software)">small and flexible open source framework written in Ruby</a> which enabled her site to make API calls to her business's Instagram feed so that virtually all content is dynamically generated using Schouvi's most current work.
    </p>

    <div class="pi-slide">
      <img src="/img/style/schouvi-homepage.png" alt=""/>
    </div>

    Project Discovery and Planning</h3>
    <p class="">
      Schouvi had a strong Instagram presence but no website prior to this so we began by discussing the style and personality she wanted to convey to potential clients. We also did an informal discovery process to identify the type of content and general organization she wanted to present. Because, as a stylist, she spends a lot of time with clients, we decided early on that content updates for her site needed to be fast, easy, and mobile-capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      We explored a variety of website content types and layouts and quickly realized that because her services are so uniquely tailored to each client, it didn't make sense to post services and pricing in a static format on her site. Instead, we decided to let her work speak for itself and direct clients to contact her for further information.  Since she was already using Instagram heavily to share images of her work, it was an obvious choice to create an <a href="http://schouvistylist.com/"></a>Instagram photo gallery</a>.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      A key feature of this integration is the filters displayed to the left in desktop views and at the top right in mobile views. These filters can be clicked to display only images matching that filter criteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      The filters themselves are dynamically generated using key hashtags such as "short cuts", "color repair", and "full color". This ensures that the filters in use will always have at least one current photo to display.
    </p>

    Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h5>
    <p>
      I added Google Analytics to her site and included all relevant information about her site in Google's webmaster tools to ensure that data is being collected about how clients find the site and how they use it once they get there.
